# Weather- Dashboard


## Introduction:

I have created a weather dashboard using Third-party APIs that allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This application is retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of displaying weather of different cities. This weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```



## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](.//Assets/demo.png)


This weather dashboard has form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
